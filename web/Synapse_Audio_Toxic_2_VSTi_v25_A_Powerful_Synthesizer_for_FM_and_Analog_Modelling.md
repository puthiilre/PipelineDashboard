One of the most impressive features of Synapse Audio Toxic 2 VSTi v2.5 is its sound quality. The plugin uses a hybrid synthesis engine that combines FM and analog modelling to produce rich and complex sounds. The FM engine allows you to create harmonic and inharmonic spectra using six operators, each with its own waveform, frequency ratio, amplitude envelope and modulation index. The analog engine lets you shape the sound further using four different filter types, each with its own envelope and modulation sources.
 
Synapse Audio Toxic 2 VSTi v2.5 also offers a lot of flexibility and creativity when it comes to sound design. You can use the modulation matrix to assign any of the 16 modulation sources to any of the 64 destinations, creating dynamic and expressive sounds. You can also use the arpeggiator to generate rhythmic patterns and melodies, or the multi-effects section to add some spice and polish to your sounds. The effects include chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, reverb and distortion.
 
Another great thing about Synapse Audio Toxic 2 VSTi v2.5 is its ease of use and user interface. The plugin has a sleek and modern design that makes it easy to navigate and adjust the parameters. You can access all the features and functions from a single window, which is divided into four sections: operators, filters, effects and global. You can also switch between different views and skins to suit your preferences and workflow.
